# Youth-Services-Draft-Website
Draft website back when I was working at City Hall as their website designer. I worked there for a year, and I changed a lot of things while I was there. In this small department, everyone knew each other and knew me well, they were really lenient and flexible over my senior year of high school. This allowed me to really enjoy the work I was doing while making progress and influence for them. I will link the finished product [here](https://www.departmentofnorwalkyouthservices.com/).



NOTE: Take all the HTML and CSS files out of their respective folders and place them in the same directory. They go out of scope when you try to access them through 
File Explorer or Live Server, so CSS files never reach the document. Placing the files in the same folder is ok and accessing through File Explorer/Live Server is ok too.
