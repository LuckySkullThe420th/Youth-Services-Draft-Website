             <h2 id="Bold">Services Defined</h2>
               <p>Care Coordination Services are available to youth, ages 11 to 18,
                and their families who reside in Norwalk.
                Referrals for care coordination come from various sources,
                including:
                 <ul class="Services-content">
                    <a href="https://portal.ct.gov/dcf"><li>Connecticut Department of Children and Families(DCF)</li></a>
                      
                    
                    <li>
                    Juvenile Review Board
                    </li>

                    <li>
                     Various other agencies
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The general community
                    </li>
                 </ul>

                <p> Care Coordination Services consists of an initial assessment of needs, 
                 generally conducted in person or virtually via a platform such as zoom.  
                 Although behavioral health (counseling / therapy) needs are a primary focus, 
                 all other needs for which a youth and family may require or benefit are assessed.  
                 These might include mentorship, a youth development program, a Parks & Recreation program, 
                 or social services needs addressed via the City's family navigator program.  
                 A care plan is then developed with the family and appropriate referrals and linkages are facilitated.  
                 The care coordinator works to ensure services connections happen so youth and families don't, "fall thru the cracks."
                </p>
                 <h2 id="Bold">Hours and Regulations</h2>
                 <p>Our hours for care coordination services are flexible either during our regular office hours 8:30 am to 5:00 pm,
                  or during early evenings per appointment. Families 
                 are asked to contact the Department directly to provide brief intake information
                 and to schedule an initial intake / assessment session.
                 
                 A parent is required to attend an intake / assessment session
                  with the referred youth and must sign a consent for service connections to be provided. 
                 Youth may be seen alone without parental consent under some circumstances.
                 </p>
